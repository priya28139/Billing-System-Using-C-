# Billing-System-Using-C++
A program developed using C++ intended at exhibiting concepts of object oriented design, inheritance, virtual functions and operator overloading in action. The problem description chosen to illustrate this is as follows. Many different suppliers provides gas, phone and electricity services to their customers. There exists a file containing records indicating the type of service provided, the supplier name, customer name and address, the account balance, usage information and number of days since the last reading. The program reads this text file and creates an array of instances of the appropriate record type (Gas, Electricity or Phone) and then processes the information to generate billing amounts (based on specific formulae), calculate discounts (if the customer requests all three services from a specific supplier), and display detailed customer records.
